# COVID 19 DOCUMENT CLUSTERING
Coronavirus is a worldwide pandemic, which started in Wuhan, China, in December, has extended to contact every edge of the globe. Many individuals around the planet have been sick from the virus, and countless others have passed away. On January 11, 2020, China reported the first case of COVID death. Before long, the infection had begun to spread all around the world. There are about 116 million cases, and the population is yet to be treated. The study and progress in the research of this virus have reduced researchers' ability to get relevant information over the internet. As mutations of infections and microbes are inescapable, a danger for such pandemics remains. To guarantee that the harm is done is lesser, a literature clustering technique can be used to group relevant information together, making accessibility easier for researchers and enthusiasts alike. Furthermore, by using k-means clustering for labeling the clusters and Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, t-SNE for better visualization, a scatter plot may be used to represent the grouped collection of literature. On this bokeh plot, articles that are similar share a tag, whereas articles that are not similar are placed so far apart. Latent Dirichlet Allocation will be used to extract keywords from each cluster in order to find credibility in the groups.
